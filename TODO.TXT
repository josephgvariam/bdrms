- add global exception handler for database sql exceptions like unique constraint violated
https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc

- filter entities by user in views
https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/15/spel-support-in-spring-data-jpa-query-definitions

- implement history of various entitys. eg: file, file inventory item, etc
- remove @CreatedDate annotation for Box/File/Doc and set it in form to persist real creation times
- figure out the cache added by roo
- retention start and end dates on inventory items
- possibility to add rules/constraints to shelves when storing boxes (eg: only allow 16 boxes per shelf)
- generic barcode search to give entity details (like when boxes mixed up so find its request number)
- implicit barcode format (u can tell what kind of barcode it is by just looking at it eg: its a box barcode)
- add db indexes for datatables searches. For eg: search in inventoryItems databale list: index for inventory barcodes (box, file, doc, shelf) and refs (inventory items)
- datatables search should not run on each key press,  button maybe or min length?
- optimize hibernate queries - for eg inventory items search should not issue single query for each result, should be batched

- multiple operators work on single request parallely (eg: parallele add of records to pickup)
- option to choose storage type while doing incoming validation (another feature :- content validation)
- fix dataTables.checkboxes.js minimized (no column error)
- filter request list by type, date, status
- remove unused controller actions (eg: https://localhost:8443/inventoryitems/107/edit-form)

- Notifications






DONE
====
- better logging format
- fix incorrecxt user created for new inventory when items stored
- encrypt passwds
- generate load chart with total number of boxes and files (just a summary)
- fix verify barcode
- automated tests
- figure out this datatables search and the indexing of all fields. but box barcode search of inventory dont happen?
- cannot choose same inventory item if already part of another active request (can only choose inventory items of inactive requests)
