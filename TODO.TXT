- add global exception handler for database sql exceptions like unique constraint violated
https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc

- filter entities by user in views
https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/15/spel-support-in-spring-data-jpa-query-definitions


- multiple operators work on single request parallely (eg: parallel add of records to pickup)
- option to choose storage type while doing incoming validation (another feature :- content validation)
- possibility to add rules/constraints to shelves when storing boxes (eg: only allow 16 boxes per shelf)

- *optimize hibernate queries - for eg inventory items search should not issue single query for each result (already added batchsize but not working) - figured out its because of eager fetches: eg: FileInventoryItems -> File -> Box. Eager fetching is bad - get rid of it.
- add db indexes for datatables searches. For eg: search in inventoryItems databale list: index for inventory barcodes (box, file, doc, shelf) and refs (inventory items)

- implement history of various entitys. eg: file, file inventory item, etc
- remove @CreatedDate annotation for Box/File/Doc and set it in form to persist real creation times
- figure out the cache added by roo
- retention start and end dates on inventory items
- generic barcode search to give entity details (like when boxes mixed up so find its request number)
- implicit barcode format (u can tell what kind of barcode it is by just looking at it eg: its a box barcode)
- datatables search should not run on each key press,  button maybe or min length or a time delay?
- fix dataTables.checkboxes.js minimized (no column error)
- remove unused controller actions (eg: https://localhost:8443/inventoryitems/107/edit-form)
- fix select2 searchs for eg: assign user (prob is query text not used so replace global text by query param)
- review placeholder texts eg: assign user placeholder is "select an option"
- review all list columns, ordering, searchable, etc
- Send OTP via SMS gateway
- Get real HTTPS certificate
- Notifications
- review all request states, make sure everything can me performance metric'ed - do acknowledgement states need to be added?
- need to use local storage more, for eg: with refiling request, when re-storing records: prevent data loss of completed actions. other examples: when many actions are carried out but they are not persisted (like validating records and if refresh is done by mistake)
- review all error callbacks, as I lazily put console.logs - but need to display errors to user well
- put inventory item type icons whereever possible: like in validation screens
- enter key should close modals, submit forms - instead of clicking a button
- Uncaught TypeError: this.showAlert is not a function - search & remove occurrunces of this.showAlert
- audit spring security http://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-authentication-audit

DONE
====
- better logging format
- fix incorrecxt user created for new inventory when items stored
- encrypt passwds
- generate load chart with total number of boxes and files (just a summary)
- fix verify barcode
- automated tests
- figure out this datatables search and the indexing of all fields. but box barcode search of inventory dont happen?
- cannot choose same inventory item if already part of another active request (can only choose inventory items of inactive requests)
- filter request list by type, date, status (also "assigned to me")
- disable pagination/search state of datatables
- cannot choose record if already part of another request
- cannot save request if no records selected
