3. implement history of various entitys. eg: file, file inventory item, etc

4. better logging format

5. encrypt passwds

6. remove @CreatedDate annotation for Box/File/Doc and set it in form to persist real creation times

7. figure out the cache added by roo

24 JUNE TODOS:
- retention start and dates on inventory items
- possibility to add rules/constraints to shelves when storing boxes (eg: only allow 16 boxes per shelf)
- generate load chart with total number of boxes and files (just a summary)
- generic barcode search to give entity details (like when boxes mixed up so find its request number)
- fix verify barcode
- automated tests
- implicit barcode format (u can tell what kind of barcode it is by just looking at it eg: its a box barcode)


- generic search scan any barcode and get its details

- figure out this databasles search and the indexing of all fields. but box barcode search of inventory dont happen?
